### Hi there 👋

I have worked in tech for 10 years, and as a front end for 6 years! and I'm currently a front-end at Blockchains. 

- 🔭 In the meantime I’m currently working on my own project, Garnister, as a full-stack dev, project manager, etc, using technologies like GraphQL, Node, MongoDB, React, Typescript, and some small Golang knowledge.

- 💬 Ask me about: anything to do with Front End! As well as Node and GraphQL.
- 📫 How to reach me: Use my email shown below!
